## Why did we build Power Thru?

To promote mental wellbeing by helping people conquer their pornography addiction

According to the UN, in the year 2020, there was a 25% increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression worldwide. According to this study published in Front Psychiatry, this coincides with a drastically increased consumption of pornographic content consumed world-wide. There are many other studies that show a direct correlation between compulsive internet pornography use and poor mental health.

## What is Power Thru?
POWER THRU is a tool that aims to support those struggling with compulsive addiction to pornographic content. This content is extremely addictive and it can have a severe negative impact on the mental health of those who are inflicted.

POWER THRU tracks a user's "streak" and visualizes it in an aesthetically pleasing way to induce a calming effect on the user and counteract the negative stigma that surrounds this topic.

Whenever the user feels like "relapsing", or indulging in their addiction, they should click on the panic button in the top left corner of this webpage. This will take them to a page that directs them to support and online resources to motivate them and help them stay strong. If the user relapses, they should click on the relapse button to reset their streak. To set the streak to a particular value, scroll up and enter the date and time of your last relapse in the date-time picker, then click on update.

We have provided a section for resources such as books and youtube videos to assist users in fighting their addiction. There is also a community section to connect users to other people struggling with similar addictions. We have also provided motivation quotes floating in the background of this webpage. To view the quotes clearly, press Q.
